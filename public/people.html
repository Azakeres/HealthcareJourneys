                        <p> <b>Bio: </b> I am originally from Indianapolis, IN and am currently studying at
                             Indiana University. I have a deep passion for social justice, and I try to focus 
                             that in my studies of migrant health, reproductive justice, and menstrual equity. 
                             In my free time, I enjoy hiking, rock-climbing, cuddling with my dog, and volunteering at a
                              local pregnancy resource center.  One day, I hope to be a medical anthropologist working and studying at 
                              the intersections of migration, health policy, and reproduction. Until then, 
                              I'll be traveling the world.  </p>

                              healthcare disparities domestically and internationally. In my free time, 
                              I enjoy cooking, volunteering at a local senior center, and drawing. In the future, 
                              I aspire to be a general or trauma surgeon practicing in a hospital somewhere in the 
                              Pacific Northwest.  </p>
